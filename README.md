# Scaled 2-Input CMOS Nand Gate using 28nm PDK

Here we have designed a Scaled-2 Input CMOS NAND Gate using the 28nm Process Design Kit available on Synopsys Custom Compiler and analyzed the output and delay in comparison to a Conventional CMOS NAND Gate using the PrimeWave Design Environment.

# Abstract

Nowadays, we observe that a complementary-metaloxide-semiconductor (CMOS) is widely used in large scale integrated circuits. Here we aim to design a scaled 2-input CMOS NAND Gate on a 28nm scale and analyze its output behavior along with the delay analysis for the same in comparison to a conventional 2-input CMOS NAND Gate. NAND gates are basic universal gates because with the help of these gates, we can create any digital circuit. Most of the CMOS Nand gate design techniques need either a p-logic block or an n-logic block for evaluation of input and output behavior at a transistor level.
